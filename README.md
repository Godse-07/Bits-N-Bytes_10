## Hospital Management System Care and Cure

Welcome to the Hospital Management System **Care and Cure** repository, developed by **Team Bits N' Bytes**.

## Introduction

Our Hospital Management System Care and Cure is designed to streamline and optimize hospital management processes. With an integrated AI-powered chatbot, this system aims to provide comprehensive support for managing patient records, appointments, medical staff, inventory, billing, and patient interaction.

The AI chatbot serves as a virtual guide, assisting patients with inquiries, providing information about services, and offering support throughout their healthcare journey. Our goal is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and patient care within healthcare facilities, providing a seamless experience for both medical staff and patients.
